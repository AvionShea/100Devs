//--- Easy
//create a variable and assign it a number
let variableAssignedToANumber = 3;

//minus 10 from that number
newNumber = variableAssignedToANumber - 10;

//print that number to the console
console.log(newNumber);

//--- Medium
//create a variable that holds a value from the input
let holdsAValue = document.querySelector("#danceDanceRevolution").value;

//add 25 to that number
let holdsANewValue = holdsAValue += 25;

//alert that number
alert(holdsANewValue);

//--- Hard
//create a variable that holds the h1

//add an event listener to that element that console logs the sum of the two previous variables
